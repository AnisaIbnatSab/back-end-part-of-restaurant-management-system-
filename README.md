    <p>The Django backend is designed to manage restaurants, menus, orders, and payments efficiently that provides a robust API with user authentication, permissions, and integration with Stripe for payment processing.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom User Model:</strong> Extended to include additional fields necessary for user profiles, such as roles (owners and employees).</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Utilizes Django's built-in authentication system for secure login and session management.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Custom permissions are implemented to control access to different parts of the application, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., manage orders, menus).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Restaurant Management</p>
