    <p>The Django backend is designed to manage restaurants, menus, orders, and payments efficiently that provides a robust API with user authentication, permissions, and integration with Stripe for payment processing.</p>
    <br>
    User and Authentication
    <br>
        <li><strong>Custom User Model:</strong> Extended to include additional fields necessary for user profiles, such as roles (owners and employees).</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Utilizes Django's built-in authentication system for secure login and session management.</li>
        <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Custom permissions are implemented to control access to different parts of the application, ensuring only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., manage orders, menus).</li>
    
    
    <br>
    Restaurant Management
    <br>
        <li><strong>Restaurant Model:</strong> Represents a restaurant, including fields like name, description, location, and owner.</li>
        <li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong> Allows restaurant owners to create, update, and list their restaurants. Only authenticated owners can perform these actions.</li>
    
    <br> 
    Menu Management
<br>
        <li><strong>Menu and MenuItem Models:</strong> Represent menus and their items associated with a restaurant.</li>
        <li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong> Enable owners to create and update menus and menu items. Owners can also list all menus for their restaurants.</li>

    
    <br>
    Order Management
    <br>
        <li><strong>Order and OrderItem Models:</strong> Represent customer orders and the items within those orders, including details like items, quantity, and price.</li>
        <li><strong>API Endpoints:</strong> Allow users to create and manage orders based on available menu items. Only authorized users can place and manage orders.</li>
    
    
    <br> 
    Payment Processing
    <br>
        <li><strong>Stripe Integration:</strong> Uses the Stripe API to handle secure payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment API:</strong> Provides endpoints to process payments, handling payment information securely using Stripe tokens.</li>
    
    
    <br>
    User Roles and Permissions
    <br>
        <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Defines roles for users (owners and employees) to manage who can access and modify restaurant data.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Permissions:</strong> Ensures that only users with the correct permissions can create, view, or modify data related to restaurants, menus, orders, and payments.</li>
